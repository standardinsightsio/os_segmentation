# RFM Analysis

- R (Recency): Analyzes how recently a customer made a purchase. You can calculate this by finding the difference (in days, weeks, etc.) between the most recent purchase date and a specific reference date (e.g., today).
- F (Frequency): Represents how often a customer makes purchases. This is typically the total number of purchases made within a defined period.
- M (Monetary): Indicates the total amount a customer spends. You can calculate this by summing the purchase value of all their transactions.
Customer Segmentation:

## Data Preparation:
 - Load your customer transaction data into a Python data structure (e.g., Pandas DataFrame).
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values and ensuring consistent data formats (e.g., dates).

## RFM Scores:
- Calculate recency, frequency, and monetary values for each customer.
- You can use various techniques to assign RFM scores:
- Quantiles: Divide each RFM dimension (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) into quartiles (four groups). Customers are assigned scores (1 to 4) based on which quartile their value falls into (1 being the lowest, 4 being the highest).
- Custom scoring: Define custom logic based on your business context. For instance, a recent high-value purchase might deserve a higher score than a frequent low-value purchase.

## Segmentation:
- Combine RFM scores into a single RFM string (e.g., "R3F2M4").
- Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) or rule-based approaches to segment customers into groups based on their RFM scores.

## Analysis and Action:
- Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.
- Identify valuable segments like "Loyal Champions" (high RFM scores) or "At-Risk" customers (low recency).
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns or loyalty programs based on these segments.

## Benefits:
- Understand customer behavior patterns.
- Identify profitable customer segments.
- Develop targeted marketing strategies.
- Improve customer retention and acquisition.
